Problem set 6 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science focusses on learning a new language: Python (where before we only used C).
It consists of two major parts:

1. Sentimental; Here the excercise is to implement the Hello, Mario, Credit and Vigenere programs from CS50_Pset1 in Python.

2. Similarities; This is a website that takes two text files as inputs, checks them on similarities and highlights all similarities found.

NB: In Similarities, various parts of the code were provided by the CS50 staff. My own code can be found in the following places:

1. Helpers.py -> the functions 'lines', 'sentences' and 'substrings'
2. templates/index.html
